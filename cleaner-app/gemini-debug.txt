# Gemini Debugging Notes for DustInTime-MVP

## Objective
Get the DustInTime-MVP application running locally. This involves starting the backend and frontend servers and ensuring they can communicate with each other.

## Debugging Plan

### Step 1: Backend Server
1.  **Run the backend server** with `nodemon` to automatically restart on file changes and log output.
    - Command: `npm run dev`
    - Directory: `/home/xibalbasolutions/Desktop/DustInTime-MVP/backend`
2.  **Analyze the output** for rapid restarts or error messages. An infinite loop might cause `nodemon` to restart continuously.
    - If there are errors, document them in this file.
    - Common errors to look for:
        - Missing environment variables (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`).
        - Database connection issues.
        - Port conflicts.
        - Code that triggers a file change, causing a loop.
3.  **Propose and apply fixes** for any identified errors.
    - This may involve creating a `.env` file, installing missing dependencies, or modifying the code.

### Step 2: Frontend Server
1.  **Run the frontend server** in the foreground.
    - Command: `npm run dev`
    - Directory: `/home/xibalbasolutions/Desktop/DustInTime-MVP`
2.  **Analyze the output** for any error messages.
    - If there are errors, document them in this file.
    - Common errors to look for:
        - Missing environment variables (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
        - Issues with the Vite configuration.
        - Port conflicts.
3.  **Propose and apply fixes** for any identified errors.

### Step 3: Application Testing
1.  **Access the frontend** in a browser (the URL will be in the output of the `npm run dev` command, typically `http://localhost:5173`).
2.  **Test the application's functionality**.
    - Pay attention to the browser's developer console for any errors.
    - Check for network errors in the developer console, which might indicate problems with the backend communication.
3.  **Document any issues** and repeat the debugging cycle until the application is stable.
